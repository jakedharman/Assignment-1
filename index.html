<h1>My IT Profile</h1> 
<h2>Personal Information</h2>
<p>Hi there!
    My name is Jake and I’m a lifelong Melbournian. In the past I’ve started and stopped higher education, having begun both a Bachelor of Biomedical Science at La Trobe and a Bachelor of Design with RMIT. 
    Both of these were many years ago, and I made the decision to enter the workforce instead of studying something that just wasn’t for me. 
    As such my education doesn’t go too far past year 12 (although I do have my forklift licence if needed)
</p>
<p>
    While I am partial to sunsets and long walks on the beach, my favourite pastimes are playing guitar and playing video games, time permitting. 
    My picture is from a recent trip to Tasmania, where in my infinite wisdom I decided to rent the smallest possible soft-top convertible to go to Port Arthur on the most miserable and wet day that week. 
    I would definitely recommend going if you haven’t already been, and make sure to visit Mona (https://mona.net.au/) if you do, it is amazing.
