<h1>My IT Profile</h1> 
<h2>Personal Information</h2>
<p>
    Hi there!
    My name is Jake and I’m a lifelong Melbournian. In the past I’ve started and stopped higher education, having begun both a Bachelor of Biomedical Science at La Trobe and a Bachelor of Design with RMIT. 
    Both of these were many years ago, and I made the decision to enter the workforce instead of studying something that just wasn’t for me. 
    As such my education doesn’t go too far past year 12 (although I do have my forklift licence if needed)
</p>
<p>
    While I am partial to sunsets and long walks on the beach, my favourite pastimes are playing guitar and playing video games, time permitting. 
    My picture is from a recent trip to Tasmania, where in my infinite wisdom I decided to rent the smallest possible soft-top convertible to go to Port Arthur on the most miserable and wet day that week. 
    I would definitely recommend going if you haven’t already been, and make sure to visit Mona (https://mona.net.au/) if you do, it is amazing.
</p> 

<h2>Interest in IT</h2>
<p>
    As a recovering luddite I’m trying to learn more about the workings of IT for personal knowledge, as well as increasing employability in the future.
    My initial interest in IT started over ten years ago when I built my first gaming PC that got me through hundreds of hours of Tribes: Ascend, Mount and Blade, Skyrim and Left 4 Dead. 
    The push to learn how to build one was purely financial; as a poor student with minimal income and a budding gaming addiction, pre-built PCs were out of the question.
</p>
<p>
    Since then I’ve worked for various private and government enterprises using software systems that have ranged from barely-adequate to functional in name only. 
    My goal is to be able to work on the functionality of online systems both for the users and for the people processing information, potentially with a focus on UI and UX. 
    What I focus on is subject to change though, as I learn and grow throughout my studies.
</p>
<p>
    My choice of RMIT was based on the availability of courses through Online Universities Australia. 
    As I work full-time I needed an online course structure that took place after hours and RMIT’s Bachelor of IT suited perfectly.
</p>
<p>
    With this degree I hope to gain a wide understanding of the components that come together to produce the software we use all the time in our daily lives. 
    Personally, a great deal of my IT knowledge is still “the magic box gives the internet and does my taxes for me”, and I’m ready to look behind the curtain and start exploring how this technology actually works.
</p>

<h2>Ideal Job</h2>
<p>
    The job I chose is UX Lead with Just Digital.
</p>
<p>
    The position is a leadership role within a UX design team, liaising with clients and stakeholders to understand business needs and objectives to deliver the best digital experience for their needs. 
    This role also has research components, with development and design work.The appeal of the role is mainly focused on finding solutions for clients; 
    applying appropriate research and being able to take on something new dependent on needs.
</p>
<p>
    The application lists tertiary qualification as desirable, meaning that a greater focus will be on a portfolio and proven history of achievement with at least 5 years of products to show for it. 
    Specific skills are required with the UX tools Figma, Optimal Workshop, and the applications within the Adobe Creative Cloud, alongside other supplementary tools Miro, Slickplan and Google Docs. 
    Further, provable skills are required in managing and mentoring a team.
</p>
<p>
    I currently have experience managing/mentoring teams in a non-design context, and have some limited experience with the Adobe Suite. 
    Bridging the gap to where I would be able to comfortably apply for this job would require years of experience; 
    some possible while working towards my degree but for the most part would be taking on personal projects and building a portfolio.
</p>
